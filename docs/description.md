A **progress bar** that shows your progress in terms of **passed cards per review session**.

### USAGE

The customization and use of the Progress Bar add-on is demonstrated in the following video (alongside other similar add-ons):

[![YouTube: Anki add-on guide: Gamify Your Reviews](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UkveLkAgXiM/mqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/UkveLkAgXiM)

The bar can't be seen from the list of decks. It opens in a deck's overview page, and, by default, the bar goal for a session is the total new, lapsed, and due cards in the deck at that point. Upon completion, the bar remains full as you're taken to the deck's overview state. If you leave the review state otherwise, the bar resets.

### CONFIGURATION

By making small changes at the top of the add-on's source code, you can change the colors, make the corners more rounded, decide whether to  see the percentage (e.g., "50%"), or alter the bar's orientation (horizontal or vertical), location (which of the window's four sides), and direction (which way it moves).

The configuration section will also allow you to customize how your card tally is calculated. By default, both new cards, cards in learning, and review cards are factored in. Each of these queues can be individually toggled off by setting its respective variable to `False` at the top of the config section.
