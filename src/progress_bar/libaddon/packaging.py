# Registering external libraries & modules

# NOTE: Use of these is discouraged and should be reserved for cases where
#       traditional vendoring fails or is not feasible to implement.

# NOTE: I have yet to find a reliable way to add modules to packages
# that *do* ship with Anki, but are missing specific sub-modules
# (e.g. 'version' module of 'distutils')
#
# The issue mainly arises when Anki has already loaded the corresponding
# module at add-on init time. At that point it becomes non-trivial to
# update the module cache with our own version of the module.
#
# It is easy to make due with explicitly importing our own version of
# the module if we have control over the code-base, but in case of
# dependencies of other modules this becomes a major problem
# (e.g. third-party packages depending on stdlib modules missing
# in Anki's Python distribution).
